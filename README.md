# GTA-V-Default-Handling-Files---FiveM-resource

A copy of the default handling.meta files found in GTA V. Saved for future reference and set up as a FiveM resource.

To use drop the 'handling' folder into your resources folder and add `start handling` to your server.cfg file.  

The Unified-handling.meta file is there to combine all wheeled vehicles together into one file, this is in alphabetical order and with common formatting as R_ should have done in the first place.  
The rest of the files are ripped straight from R_'s files for a reference.
